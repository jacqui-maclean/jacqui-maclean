### Hi there 👋

I'm Jacqui a self-taught React developer from the UK.

### About me

Spent 7 years running my own digital solution building websites for local businesses.
Then took several roles in start-up, scale-ups and government agencies gaining experience in React, Agile, TypeScript and unit testing.
Enjoy building engaging apps, and believe UI/UX to be hugely important.
Have a lot of experience integrating geographical maps into React applications.
